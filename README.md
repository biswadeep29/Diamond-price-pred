# Diamond Price Prediction App

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a diamond based on its characteristics such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other dimensions. The model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application.

## Features:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond (key feature for price prediction).
- **Cut**: Quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium).
- **Color**: Grade of the diamond's color (e.g., D, E, F).
- **Clarity**: Clarity grade of the diamond (e.g., SI1, VVS1).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the diamond's top facet as a percentage of the total width.
- **Length, Width, Height**: Dimensions of the diamond in millimeters.
